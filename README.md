This web application, built fully using Python, has been built as an OpenAI API Project which serves three purposes: as a Conversational Agent, Speech Generator and Image Generator.
It is basically built using OpenAI module and StreamLit library.

While making this project, I have referred to StreamLit documentation on the following link: 
https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/tutorials/build-conversational-apps

To access this web application, you have to visit https://platform.openai.com/api-keys and generate an API key to enter into the prompt for the API key. 
Make an account on https://platform.openai.com before generating an API key, if not made yet. $5 credits will be given for free.

Additionally, I have included the Python Notebook for the code, which was written before I had built the web application and can be run on Google Collab or Jupyter. The HTML version of the Python code has been given as comments in the app.py file. In addition to it, the CSS file for the same has also been given separately.
